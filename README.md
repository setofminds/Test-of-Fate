# Test-of-Fate

It is dual player game . One is red player other is blue player. Both are trapped in a dungeon . Only one can escape from here. But for this you have to do some great stuff. Let's see the rules -

At first the intro will pop up.
To  move forward PRESS => Enter key

1. There are two teams - red , blue
2. For each team there will be a winning combination of head. ( like: up down down up down . Up means head up , down means head down ).
3. After the intro we will show both of you the winning combinations. But be careful! As soon as the game starts the combinations will disappear. So both player have to memorize the combinations.
4. Now you have to start the game by rolling the dices. For this press Enter.
5. The color of the dice which appears in greater number will enable that same colored team to make a move .
	For example:  If blue dice is greater in number than red then its time for blue team to make a move. And vice versa.
6. The team that gets the move can only change the configuration of the head corresponding to the opposite color.
 	for example: if the read team gets to make a move then it can only change the heads right above the blue dices.
7.  To move the head use the mouse ( left click ) to click on the allowed set of heads .
8. You can only click a head at a time and then press enter.
9. The first team to match the winning combination of heads wins.


To move forward in intro => Press Enter

To shuffle the heads => mouse left click on the heads.

Hope you will have a nice game experience. Enjoy!
